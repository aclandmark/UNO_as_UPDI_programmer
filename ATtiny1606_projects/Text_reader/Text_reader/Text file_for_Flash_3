The UPDI inteface:	Defines the way that many new AVR devices are to be programmered, MISO, MOSI, SCK lines are dispensed with just leaving the reset pin.

For default settings the reset pin is connected to a single pin UART that can be switched between an input and output.  Config bytes enble this pin to be converted to reset only.

If this is done a 12V suppply is required to re-enable programming.   

This program is a UNO project that enables Attiny 808/1606 chips to be programmed using the UPDI protocol. These chips have been chosen becuase they offer HW UART and I2C modules and a SOIC footprint.

The SOIC footprint is ideal for anyone wishing to migrate to SM designs, (but make sure that plenty of copper is available for the soldering iron.  Commercial footprints may need adjusting.)

Both hex and text files can be programmed to flash.  The Attiny 1606 has 16kBytes of flash and two have been reseved for text. This reservation cab be altered or elliminated if necessary.

For demonstration purposes an ATtiny 1606 is permanently connected to a UNO.  Initially the UNO programms the 1606 with sample hex and text files.  The hex  reads the text and performs some simple arithmetic.

The UNO programmer is then replaced with an other sample program.  This communicates with a PC and controls the 1606, sending it numbers and requesting the strings.

Space allowing the programmer and sample program can be combined before being uploaded as a single program to the UNO.

Microchip have made slight changes to the code required to setup the IO lines and the peripherals. The sample 1606 program includes timer TCA, the watchdog timer and UART with separate Rx and Tx lines, since these are common requirements.

Text strings are identified as either number 1,2,3,4...... and subroutines required to read them are also provided.
